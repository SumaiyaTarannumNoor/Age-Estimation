# Age-Estimation
This is a deep learning project to solve classification problem to estimate ages, developed using PyTorch framework.
The experiments were conducted on three different and reputed age estimation dataset: FG - NET, AGE DB, UTK FACE.
We have used focal loss as the loss function, as the examples in the classes were insufficient.
